## Adding your own companies

- Run add_company.py

- Follow the instructions in the command line interface

- For 'Example job title', when you open the link to the job page just copy and paste the exact title of a random job

- Just select y or n if the selector is getting all the jobs correctly. Entering y will add the name, link, and selector to companies.csv, so you should make a pr if you want it to be included in the scraping

Here's an example:
